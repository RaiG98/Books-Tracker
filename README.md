# Books-Tracker
This is a python script that is used to interact with an SQLite database that holds information on books. The script defines several functions that allow a user to perform various actions on the database, such as inserting a new book, updating book information, deleting a book, searching for a book, and printing the contents of the books table. The script also defines a while loop that provides a menu to the user, allowing them to select which action they want to perform on the database. The script makes use of the sqlite3 library to connect to and interact with the database, as well as the tabulate library to format the contents of the books table when printed to the screen.
## To use the programme:
1. Begin by running the Initialise_the_books_table.py file. Running this programme will create the database which will used by Book_Clerks_Tool.py.
